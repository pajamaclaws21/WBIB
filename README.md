# WBIB
A baby "web browser" in your browser<sup>1</sup>. I got this idea when I was trying to make a SpaceTraders-API-based game in Snap<em>!</em>, but got stuck when there were so so so many features. It's changed so much over the course of many many many commits, and was largely written on W3Schools' TryIt editor. It currently uses AllOrigins as a CORS proxy. To go to different websites, type in a website without the <em>www, www1</em>, etc. and/or <em>https://, http://</em> (i.e. reddit.com or google.com) to the input ahd then press enter! I have a nice formatter for searching on Google, called WBIB-Google, although that's all it's used for. **NOTE THAT TO USE THIS PROPERLY, YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME SENSE OF HOW THE INTERNET WORKS!** I don't have all of Google's data, or Reddit's, and my website can't handle their redirects, so you're gonna need to do a lot of link editing to use this well. Sorry about that.
