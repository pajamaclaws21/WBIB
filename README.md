# WBIB
A baby "web browser" in your browser<sup>1</sup>. I got this idea when I was trying to make a SpaceTraders-API-based game in Snap<em>!</em>, but got stuck when there were so so so many features. It's changed so much over the course of many many many commits, and was largely written on W3Schools' TryIt editor. It currently uses CORS-Anywhere, but I'll be running my own soon that only takes requests from my GitHub page. To go to different websites, type in a website without the <em>www, www1</em>, etc. and/or <em>https://, http://</em> (i.e. reddit.com or google.com) to the input ahd then press enter!

<sup>1</sup> Not a fully-fledged web browser, just something to show webpages inside a webpage. <br>
