# WBIB
A baby "web browser" in your browser<sup>1</sup>. I got this idea when I was trying to make a SpaceTraders-API-based game in Snap<em>!</em>, but got stuck when there were so so so many features. Note that this doesn't bypass anything<sup>2</sup>, to my knowledge, so if a website is blocked it'll show up as blocked. Currently, the project is super barebones and it doesn't include much (just the object tag used to show the website).

  <sup>1</sup> Not a fully-fledged web browser, just something to show webpages inside a webpage. <br>
  <sup>2</sup> This project may evolve, at some point, to include a CORS proxy. There are no plans at this moment to include one, though, and since there's a lot of stuff going on with the project at the moment, it probably won't happen soon!</small>
